# RubiksTimer
Easy python project that allows you to measure the time you take to solve a Rubik's Cube. It initially shows you the scramble (for the classic 3x3 cube) along with a list of your previous times, as well as the average at the bottom. 


I'm planning on adding a GUI to make this program more enjoyable and appealing.
